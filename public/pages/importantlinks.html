            <div class="body">Discord is an "all-in-one voice and text chat". It was designed with gamers in mind, but since it's pretty cool, CFCSC is using it. We will use the discord to stay connected between meetings. Make sure you've joined and assigned your roles in the "roles" channel so that you don't miss any announcements  or reminders. Feel free to chat, show off what you're working on, or ask for help in your classes.</div>

            <div class="body">The Google Drive has folders for every meeting, so you can look at the slideshows and practice problems for each one. Use this to review or to catch up if you missed a meeting. We will be downloading the practice problems from the drive during meetings.</div>
